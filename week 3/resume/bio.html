          <p class="bio"><span class="cap">H</span>ello my name is Gary Shikhelman. I was born in Russia, but at the age of seven, my family and I immigrated to the United States as political refugees. I learned at an early age the value of hard work and dedication.</p>
          <p>In High school my appreciation of layout developed as I excelled in my design classes. I developed a passion for art, so as an adult I decided to pursue my childhood dream and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Design.</p>
          <p>Design is everywhere. As a designer I love demonstrating the millions of possibilities one can create to express an idea. I am a passionate designer and ready for any challenge.</p>
